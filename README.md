# Operating-system-project-sjf-scheduling-c-opensuse
This project is an implementation of the Shortest Job First (SJF) CPU scheduling algorithm using the C programming language. It was developed and tested on OpenSUSE Linux, as part of an academic project for the Operating Systems course.
## 📌 Description

The program:
- Accepts user input for the number of processes and their burst times.
- Sorts the processes based on burst time (SJF – Non-preemptive).
- Calculates the waiting time and turnaround time for each process.
- Prints a table of results along with the average waiting and turnaround times.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Language: C
- OS Tested On: OpenSUSE Linux (Linux-based system)
- Concept: CPU Scheduling – Shortest Job First (Non-Preemptive)
